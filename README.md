Mailman 2.3

This is a fork of Mailman 2.1.

The goals of this project are

* Port the code to Python 3
* Fix unpatched XSS (and other) vulnerabilities
* Add CAPTCHA to more places, such as entering passwords
* Port the code to Python 3
* Switch to using password reset emails instead of mailing passwords
* Switch to storing passwords hashed
* Switch to using global passwords instead of per mailing list
* Have list owners log in with their email account and password
  * Add email addresses to logs (eg when someone approves a message)
 
I will be releasing interim patches prior completing the project.
